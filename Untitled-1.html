<p> AI</p>
<p>&nbsp;AL IS DANGEROUS</p>
<p>Now CHATGPT is very palpularity, but the negative effect is bigger too. People will lose their orginal own job. And the require for human decrease.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.&nbsp; AI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they may not have been aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors.</p>

<p>AI IS BOT EASY TO CONTROL</p>
<p>Al might have their own thought in one day, human do not have the right or power to control them.&nbsp;How does AI work? As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular. </p>

<p>DON"T DEPEND ON AI&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI create by us, but it might betray us in one day, so AI do not have creativity and bram as human. THat is why Al now is a positive effects for humans.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.</p>
