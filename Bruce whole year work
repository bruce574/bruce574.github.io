<p> AI's ARTICLE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of sadness and grieve,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feeling of being all alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The feeling of not knowing what to do, The feeling of being lost and confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feeling of being scared and anxious, The feeling of not being able to cope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the feelings that I have, The feelings that I am struggling to ignore.</p>
<p>MY INTEREST FOR THIS</p>
<p>my in put require for AI is to write a poem about sadness feeling and grieve. I hope AI can create a feeling of&nbsp;  Sadness is characterized by a low mood or feeling down, often in response to something that was disappointing or discouraging, or caused other negative feelings. Sadness can happen on its own, but is usually relieved by the passage of time, self-care activities, or doing something you enjoy to cheer yourself up. I hope AI can have some fact to prove how sadness is, because&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You have 43 facial muscles expressing the whole spectrum of emotions. Emotions can last from less than a second to several minutes. Sad emotions tend to affect you for longer than the positive ones. Mood lasts much longer than an emotion.</p>
<p>MY FEEDBAVK FOR THIS POEM</p>
<p>I think this is not what the poem I expect. Firstly, it looks very bored, when I read it, it just repeat the same sructure and change a fews word in different sentences. so I think is did not express a emotions that touch audience heart. Secondly, it shows some example that we will do when we are saad, but the feeling is bad, i mean it just show some feeature of sad, but it do not have a final theme or idea and those emotions words look very saperate. AI did not use descriptive language or any other good method for write a poem, it just telling in a very normal way. overall, I believe that AI's writing will never better than human or always achieve the things audience expect, because AI do not have the creativity and own thought as same as huma. It just a code fobored writing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;while AI systems may be able to assist with certain aspects of the writing process or generate content in specific contexts, it is unlikely that they will fully replace human authors in the near future &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> Bruce AI painter work</p>
<p>Intro:&nbsp; &nbsp;To create AI-generated art, artists use AI as a creative tool and work with algorithms to set up specific rules through which machines analyze thousands of images to comprehend a particular creation process, like a specific style or aesthetic.&nbsp; &nbsp; Artificial intelligence art is any artwork, particularly images and musical compositions, created through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs, such as text-to-image models and musical generators.&nbsp;What is an AI art generator? An AI art generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate art, such as images, drawings, or paintings. These generated artworks can be created in a variety of styles and can be used for various purposes, such as for digital media, advertising, or art exhibits.&nbsp; Ai-Da is "the world's first ultra-realistic humanoid robot". Completed in 2019, Ai-Da is an artificial intelligence robot that makes drawings, paintings, and sculptures. She is named after Ada Lovelace. Ai-Da. Ai-Da with self-portrait (2021).&nbsp;  So what is A.I. Description? It is an automatically generated description of an image, as our A.I. engine will scan and analyze the image and will generate three (3) suggested descriptions of that image, describing people, object, places, and what activity is happening.&nbsp;The virtual paint application's fundamental goal is to deliver an AI-based tool that allows users to draw anything on screen using hand movements. This system also gives the user the option of selecting any tool from the toolbar.&nbsp; artificial intelligence For “AI artists,” the art-making process involves figuring out what string of words will generate the best image — not what colors to mix or brush strokes to try. Even the artistically challenged can produce decent, sometimes deceptive, images using artificial intelligence text-to-image generators.&nbsp; How do you phrase AI art prompt? Use clear and concise language to describe what you want the AI to create. Be specific and focus on subject and style keywords instead of connecting words. Use multiple adjectives and write at least 3 to 7 words for the prompt.&nbsp;One of the most remarkable AI-created art is the painting “Portrait of Edmond de Belamy” by the French collective Obvious. The painting was generated by a neural network trained on a dataset of 15,000 portraits. The results are remarkably realistic, and the painting was sold at auction for $432,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the things i did is input an car name and choose an types of effect by using dream.a, and it will came out a picture.&nbsp;</p>
